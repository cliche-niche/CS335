This repository houses assignment submissions made by me in the course CS335 (2022-23 II Sem.) at IIT-K. A brief description of each assignment has been provided below:

+ [<u>Assignment 1:</u>](./A1/) The assignment was based on lexical analysis, and required the usage of Flex to scan codes in a toy language and Java. <br> 2+3 marks deducted on private test cases.
+ [<u>Assignment 2:</u>](./A2/) The assignment was based on making parsers for some grammars (pen-paper) and making a parser for a dissertation (the parser code is incomplete, however, the bison files in [WCTC](https://github.com/cliche-niche/WCTC) run properly). <br> 5 marks deducted in problem 1, 44 marks deducted in problem 4 due to segmentation faults.
+ [<u>Assignment 3:</u>](./A3/) The assignment was based on intermediate representation. <br> No marks deducted.
