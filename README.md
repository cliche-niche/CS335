This repository houses assignment submissions made by me in the course CS335 (2022-23 II Sem.) at IIT-K. A brief description of each assignment has been provided below:

+ [<u>Assignment 1:</u>](./A1/) The assignment was based on lexical analysis, and required the usage of Flex to scan codes in a toy language and Java.
+ [<u>Assignment 2:</u>](./A2/) The assignment was based on making parsers for some grammars (pen-paper) and making a parser for a dissertation (the parser does not run currently).
